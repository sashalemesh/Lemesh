If you have already installed the theme, you can proceed to <a href="#">Setting a Homepage</a> section.</div>
          <h2 id=""><span>Method 1 (Recommended): Installing using Admin</span></h2>
          <p>You can install Neptune to your website by using the <strong>Add New Themes</strong> option in the <strong>Appearance</strong> sub-menu.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Log in to the WordPress Administration Panels.</li>
            <li>
              <p>Select the <strong>Appearance</strong> panel, then <strong>Themes</strong>.</p>
              <p><img class="screenshot-img" src="img/shot3.jpg" alt=""></p>
            </li>
            <li>Select <strong>Add New</strong>.</li>
            <li>
              <p>Use the <strong>Upload Theme</strong> link on top to upload a zipped copy of a Theme that you have previously downloaded to your machine. File to upload is called <strong>neptune-by-osetin.zip</strong>, it should be located <strong>inside</strong> of the archive you downloaded from ThemeForest</p>
              <p><img class="screenshot-img" src="img/shot9.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><img class="screenshot-img" src="img/shot4.jpg" alt=""></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>When Wordpress finishes installing the theme and outputs a <strong>"Theme installed successfully"</strong> message, click <strong>Activate</strong> link.</p>
              <p><img class="screenshot-img" src="img/shot10.jpg" alt=""></p>
            </li>
            <li>That's it, now the theme is installed &amp; activated.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>




        <div class="topic-block">
          <h2 id="headingInstallingTheTheme3"><span>Method 2: Installation by using cPanel</span></h2>
          <p>If your host offers the cPanel control panel, and the Theme files are in a .zip or .gz archive follow these instructions. Note: This assumes the Theme you download is a compressed (.zip) file containing a folder under which all the Theme files reside.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Download the Theme .zip file to your local machine.</li>
            <li>In cPanel File Manager, navigate to your Themes folder. If your WordPress is installed in the document root folder of your web server you would navigate to "public_html/wp-content/themes" and if you have WordPress installed in a sub-folder called wordpress, you would navigate to "public_html/wordpress/wp-content/themes".</li>
            <li>Once you've navigated to the Themes folder in cPanel File Manager, click on Upload file(s) and upload that .zip file you saved in Step 1.</li>
            <li>Once the .zip file is uploaded, click on the name of that file in cPanel, then in the panel to the right, click on "Extract File Contents", and that .zip file will be uncompressed.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions below for selecting the new Theme.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>





        <div class="topic-block">
          <h2 id="headingInstallingTheTheme4"><span>Method 3: Installing "Neptune" Manually (FTP) </span></h2>
          <p>To add a new Theme to your WordPress installation, follow these basic steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Download the Theme archive and extract the files it contains. You may need to preserve the directory structure in the archive when extracting these files. Follow the guidelines provided by your Theme author.</li>
            <li>Using an FTP client to access your host web server, create a directory to save your Theme in the wp-content/themes directory provided by WordPress. For example, a Theme named Test should be in wp-content/themes/test. Your Theme may provide this directory as part of the archive.</li>
            <li>Upload the Theme files to the new directory on your host server.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions below for selecting the new Theme.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>





      <div class="topic-block">
        <h2 id="headingImportingDemoDataXML"><span>Importing Demo Data XML</span></h2>
        <p>This is an <strong>optional step</strong>. You can import a demo data to play around with and learn the features from a demo. You have to download a demo data xml file first. You can download it by <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tf-themes/wp-neptune-by-osetin/demo/neptune-by-osetin-demo-data.xml" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. It is also included with the theme download and located in <strong>"Extras"</strong> folder. There is also demo data for widgets that you see on a demo. To install demo data for widgets you need a plugin called "Widget Importer &amp; Exporter", you can download it by <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/">clicking here</a>.</p>
        <p>To import a demo data, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Install all the plugins you want to use on your site, our demo data includes following plugin data (this is optional, if you dont want some of these plugins - do not install them): 
            <ul style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
              <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/" target="_blank">Mailchimp for Wordpress </a><small> - newsletter widget</small></li>
              <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce </a><small> - ecommerce/shop plugin to sell stuff on your website (optional)</small></li>
              <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/" target="_blank">Contact Form 7 </a><small> - it is used to build the "contact me" page</small></li>
              <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/instagram-feed/" target="_blank">Instagram Feed </a><small> - used for instagram widget you see in the footer sidebar</small></li>
              <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/top-10/" target="_blank">Top 10 - Popular posts plugin </a><small> - used for popular posts widget and view counter</small></li>
              <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder/">Advanced Responsive Video Embedder </a><small> - only used if you are going to add video recipes</small></li>
              <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-css-classes/">Widget CSS classes</a><small> - this plugin is used to add "with-ribbon" class to a widget if you want it to have a ribbon behind a header</small></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Now you are ready to install demo data. Login to Wordpress <strong>Admin Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Import</strong> page.</p> 
            <p><img class="screenshot-img" src="img/shot11.jpg" alt=""></p>
          </li>
          <li>Select <strong>"Wordpress"</strong> from a list of available import formats (it may ask you to install it if you have not done so before).</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Choose File</strong></li>
          <li>
            Select a file called <strong>neptune-by-osetin-demo-data.xml</strong> that you've just downloaded and start importing content, it may take some time to import all the photos so do not refresh or navigate away from a page until you see a success message.
            <div class="message-info" style="background-color: #ff9e9e; color: #652929; border-color: #652929;">
              <p><strong>Warning!</strong></p>
              <p>You might see some <strong>Failed to import...</strong> errors after importing. These probably happen because you don't have a plugin installed that is related to that post.</p>
              <p>You can ignore those if you are not gonna use them, otherwise you will have to install the plugins you will going to use prior to importing demo data.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>By now you should have all demo posts data installed to your site, now if you want to import widgets that you see on our demo to your site you will have to install <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/">Widget importer &amp; exporter plugin</a>. Once it is installed - go to <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Widget Importer &amp; Exporter</strong> &gt; Download the widget demo data file <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tf-themes/wp-neptune/neptune.pinsupreme.com-widgets.wie" target="_blank">by clicking here</a> and then click "Import Widgets". That should import demo widgets into your site.</li>
          <li>
            <p>Now you have to assign a menu to be used on your website. <strong>Admin Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Appearance</strong> &gt; <strong>Menus</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage Locations tab</strong> and from a select box choose a <strong>Top Menu</strong> for Top Menu field and <strong>Footer Menu</strong> for Footer Menu field and click <strong>Save Changes</strong> button.</p>
            <p><img class="screenshot-img" src="img/import-menus.png" alt=""></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Final step is to set page called <strong>"Homepage"</strong> to be used as a homepage. To set it as your homepage, go to <strong>Admin Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Reading</strong> and set your "Front Page Displays" to be <strong>A Static Page</strong> with the "Homepage" selected from a "Front Page" select box.</p>
            <p><img class="screenshot-img" src="img/import-front-page.png" alt=""></p>
          </li>
          <li>That's it, now you should have demo data installed.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="topic-block">
        <h2 id="headingThemeRequirements"><span>Theme Requirements</span></h2>
        <p>Theme Neptune requires WordPress installed on your host. To run WordPress your host just needs a couple of things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PHP version 5.4 or greater</li>
          <li>MySQL version 5.5 or greater</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That's really it. We recommend Apache or Nginx as the most robust and featureful server for running WordPress, but any server that supports PHP and MySQL will do. That said, we can't test every possible environment and each of the hosts on our hosting page supports the above and more with no problems.</p>
        
        <h3>Ask for it</h3>
        <p>Here's a letter you can send to your host; copy and paste!</p>
        
        <div class="message-info">
          I'm interested in running the open-source WordPress <https://wordpress.org/> blogging software and I was wondering if my account supported the following:
          <ul>
            <li>PHP 5.4 or greater </li>
            <li>MySQL 5.5 or greater </li>
            <li>The mod_rewrite Apache module </li>

        <p>
          Once you have installed your new theme it's now time to add some recipes. 
        </p>
        <p>To create a recipe:</p>
        <p><img class="screenshot-img" src="img/shot5.png" alt=""></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click the <strong>'Recipes'</strong> tab. Click the <strong>'Add Recipe'</strong> sub-menu item.</li>
          <li>Start filling in the blanks: enter your <strong>recipe name</strong> in the upper field <span class="img-annotation">1</span>, and enter your <strong>recipe main content</strong> <span class="img-annotation">2</span> in the main post editing box below it.</li>
          <li>You can make <strong>featured posts slider</strong> appear on top of your recipe page <span class="img-annotation">3</span> by clicking on the related checkbox. </li>
          <li>There is an option to set a custom background image for your recipe <span class="img-annotation">4</span>, this will help make recipes more attractive and unique. You can also select the background image to have parallax effect <span class="img-annotation">5</span>, this way it will slide slightly slower or faster then the actual recipe content, which will make a pretty cool immersion effect.</li>
          <li>Pick a layout type for the recipe page <span class="img-annotation">6</span>.</li>
          <li>There is a field to assign a quick description for a recipe <span class="img-annotation">7</span>, it is the one that appears in quotes on a single recipe page.</li>
          <li>Fields <span class="img-annotation">8</span>, <span class="img-annotation">9</span>, <span class="img-annotation">10</span> allow you to select additional attributes for the recipe like "serves", "recipe difficulty" and "cooking time".</li>
          <li><span class="img-annotation">11</span> Allows you to add ingredients to your recipe. <a href="headingIngredients">Read more</a> here.</li>
          <li><span class="img-annotation">12</span> Allows you to add steps to your recipe. <a href="headingRecipeSteps">Read more</a> here.</li>
          <li><span class="img-annotation">13</span> Allows you to add nutritional information to your recipe. <a href="headingNutritions">Read more</a> here.</li>
          <li>As needed, select a <strong>category</strong> <span class="img-annotation">15</span>, add <strong>tags</strong> <span class="img-annotation">16</span>, and make other selections from the sections on the right hand side of the post.</li>
          <li>You can also define custom features for your recipe <span class="img-annotation">17</span>, those are useful for something like "spicy", "vegan", "gluten free" etc...You can add those in Admin -> Recipes -> Feature menu.</li>
          <li>When you are ready, click <strong>Publish</strong>. <span class="img-annotation">5</span></li>
        </ul>

            <ol>
              <li>Open "languages/default.po" file with PoEdit app (<a href="#" target="_blank">http://poedit.net/</a>) and translate the strings you want to your language.</li>
              <li>Save the translated .po file to the same "languages" directory by the appropriate name (e.g. if you are translating to French you have to use the filename fr_FR.po ) for a full list of languages please see this <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language" target="_blank">document</a></li>
              <li>Final step is adding: <pre class="code-block">define ('WPLANG', 'fr_FR');</pre> to the "wp-config.php" file located at your WordPress installation root folder.</li>

        <div class="topic-block">
          <h2 id="headingUpdatingTheme"><span>Updating theme "Neptune"</span></h2>
          <p>We will try to cover theme update process in detail, just follow steps below, it should be pretty easy.</p>
          <h3>Back Up Your Theme Files</h3>
          <p>First thing’s first – before we get started you need to back up your database and your current theme. Since we’re replacing and updating theme files, there’s a chance something could go wrong so it’s best to play it safe and have a backup.</p>
          <p>Use whatever method you feel most comfortable with. You may want to simply copy your entire WordPress directory to your computer using FTP and backup your database with a plugin. You may have a VaultPress account or a membership with some other third-party backup site that does all the hard work for you.</p>
          <p class="message-info">You can read more information about Wordpress backups by <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>
          <h3>Uploading and Replacing an Existing Theme</h3>
          <p>It is required that you manually upload a new version of a theme and replace an older version in order to upgrade it.</p>
          <p>However, if you go to <strong>Appearance</strong> &gt; <strong>Themes</strong> &gt; <strong>Add New</strong> and try to upload a new version of a theme that is already in your site's themes directory, it will fail and you’ll get an error message telling you the destination folder already exists.</p>
          <p>The reason for this error is due to the fact you can't have two folders in your themes directory with identical names.</p>

          <p>There are a couple of simple solutions:</p>
          <p>Login to your site via FTP or cPanel and delete the old theme and then upload the new version. Make sure you make a backup of the old version of your theme just in case something goes wrong.</p>
          <p>If deleting your old theme makes you nervous, another option is to rename the old version of the theme. This will allow you to successfully upload the new version of the theme.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Login to your site via FTP or cPanel and navigate to <strong>wp-content/themes/</strong> and find your old theme (folder called <strong>neptune-by-osetin</strong>).</li>
            <li>Rename your old theme something like <strong>"neptune-by-osetin-old"</strong>.</li>
            <li>Upload your new theme.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The old and new versions of the theme will both appear in the themes interface, but you will be able to distinguish them by their folder names and version numbers.</p>

          <h2 id="headingUpdatingPlugins"><span>Updating Premium Plugins inside a theme.</span></h2>
          <p>This theme comes with two premium plugins: <strong>UserPro</strong> and <strong>ACF pro</strong>. Userpro has a license code that you can see in the "Documentation" folder of your download, and you need to enter it on UserPro activation page in wordpress admin. For ACF Pro, updates are included in the latest theme version download, they are located in the "inc/plugins" folder of the theme itself. If you dont want to wait for a theme update and want always get the latest version of each plugin - you can register for an account on <a href="http://pinsupreme.com">http://pinsupreme.com</a> by clicking "Menu" button on top right and selecting "My Account" item. Then once you create an account - you can add your purchase code there which will allow you to download latest version of the included premium plugins without waiting for TF updates.</p>
          <p>If you have an older version of the ACF Pro and it asks about a licence code to update itself - ignore it - delete the plugin and install it again either by following the guides on the top of the wp admin or manually installing it from the "inc/plugins" folder of the theme.</p>

        <div class="topic-block">
          <h2 id="headingForDevelopers"><span>For Developers</span></h2>
          <p>This section is for advanced users who want to customize a default behaviour. We will explain you how to edit php files and stylesheets.</p>
          <div class="topic-block">
            <h2 id="headingForDevelopers1"><span>Child Theme</span></h2>
            <p>If you want to make changes to default behaviour of the theme and modify default .php files without losing those changes on theme updates, the best way to do it is by creating a child theme and overriding default behaviour.</p>
            <p>We have included a basic child theme in a download package that you received from ThemeForest. Folder is called <strong>neptune-by-osetin-child</strong>. You will have to upload that child theme folder to your <strong>wp-content/themes</strong> folder. If you want to override a layout of a php file you find in a theme <strong>Neptune</strong>, all you have to do is create the same file with your modifications in a <strong>neptune-by-osetin-child</strong> folder (if a file is located inside an extra directory, you will have to create that directory as well). Now theme <strong>Neptune</strong> will use that file instead of the original one.</p>
            <h3>Modifying theme's functions.php file</h3>
            <p>Unlike style.css, the functions.php of a child theme does not override its counterpart from the parent. Instead, it is loaded in addition to the parent’s functions.php. (Specifically, it is loaded right before the parent’s file.)</p>
            <p>In that way, the functions.php of a child theme provides a smart, trouble-free method of modifying the functionality of a parent theme. Say that you want to add a PHP function to your theme. The fastest way would be to open its functions.php file and put the function there. But that’s not smart: The next time your theme is updated, your function will disappear. But there is an alternative way which is the smart way: you can create a child theme, add a functions.php file in it, and add your function to that file. The function will do the exact same job from there too, with the advantage that it will not be affected by future updates of the parent theme. Do not copy the full content of functions.php of the parent theme into functions.php in the child theme.</p>
            <p>If you want to override one of the function of the theme Neptune, all you have to do is create a function with the same name in the child theme's functions.php file, that will prevend a parent theme from loading an original function.</p>

            <h2 id="headingForDevelopers2"><span>Modifying theme stylesheet variables</span></h2>
            <p>You can override default LESS css variables by modifying either <strong>/extend/php-variables.php</strong> or <strong>/extend/less-variables.less</strong> file. Make sure you backup those files if you made changes to them before you decide to update the theme, then when you finished updating put them back into respective folders in the updated theme to preserve changes you've made.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="topic-block">
            <h2 id="headingForDevelopers3"><span>Overriding theme's css</span></h2>
            <p>You have two options of overriding default theme's styles. First is to do it via <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Theme Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Appearance</strong> tab &gt; enter your LESS or CSS code into the textarea for "Custom CSS".</p>
            <p><img class="screenshot-img" src="img/custom-styles.png" alt=""></p>
            <p>Second option is to type in your custom styles into the <strong>/extend/custom-styles.less</strong> file. Make sure to backup this file contents before a theme update, and put it back after you udpated the theme to preserve the modifications you've added.</p>
